# Fields

This Xcode project is a Swift implementation of a framework for exploring quantum field theories using the observer pattern and functional programming concepts.

## Features

*   **QuantumField Protocol:** Defines the core behavior of a quantum field.
*   **Concrete Field Implementations:** Includes `ElectronField` (complete) and stubs for `ProtonField`, `NeutronField`, `PhotonField`, and `NeutrinoField`.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Allows objects to observe events in the quantum fields.
*   **Particle Properties:** Defines properties like mass, charge, and spin for various particles.
*   **SwiftUI Integration:** Provides stubs for `FieldGridView` and `ParticleView` for visualizing fields and particles.

## Future Development

*   Complete implementations for all field types.
*   Implement `MeasurementObserver` and `StatisticsObserver`.
*   More sophisticated field visualizations.
*   Interactive controls for simulations.
*   Integration with AI Studio for complex calculations.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `Fields.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Build and run the project.
